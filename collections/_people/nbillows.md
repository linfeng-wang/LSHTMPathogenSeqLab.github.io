I completed my undergraduate degree at Somerville College, University of Oxford in Biological Sciences. Afterwards, I moved back to my hometown in Liverpool to study Tropical Disease Biology at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine where I became more interested in bacterial genomics and bioinformatics. Now undergoing a PhD that combined my interest in infectious diseases (Tuberculosis) with statistics and machine learning.
