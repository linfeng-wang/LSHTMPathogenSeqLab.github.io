After completing my medical degree at KU Leuven University in Belgium, I worked on in vitro malaria drug screening at Cornell Medicine in New York City. I am now continuing to study malaria in my PhD at LSHTM, focused on molecular surveillance of drug resistance and using genomics to understand variation in human-to-mosquito transmissibility.
