Graduated in Nursing, I have a Ph.D. in Sciences from the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) where I have been working with malaria in pregnancy. I have extensive experience in field research, and research involving human subjects, as well as in the areas of clinical research and public health. I am currently a visiting postdoctoral researcher at LSHTM, where I am learning genomics and bioinformatics.
