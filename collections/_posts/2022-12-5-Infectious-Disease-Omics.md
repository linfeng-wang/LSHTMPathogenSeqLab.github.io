brief: Our Infectious Disease ‘omics course was hosted by the Royal Veterinary College, with many participants online. The Alan Turing Institute sponsored RVC places on the course. Specifically, this course offers hands-on experience of processing sequencing data to construct genomes, identifying genomic variants and applying downstream methods, such as phylogenetics.
