Members of the Clark/Campino groups recently organised a genomics capacity strengthening workshop in Siriraj Hospital - Mahidol University, Thailand. This follows a successful symposium in the Pampanga State Agricultural University (The Philippines) focused on AMR and TB genomics. Other funded genomics workshops will take place in Bangladesh and Vietnam later this year.
