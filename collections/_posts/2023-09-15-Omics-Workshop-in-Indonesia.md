Advancing the frontiers of scientific education, Prof Taane Clark, Dr. Jody Phelan, and talented PhD students Gabbie Ngwana-Joseph and Linfeng Wang, recently concluded a successful course in Indonesia titled "Genomics and the other omics analysis". The course, deeply rooted in the principles and applications of Next-Generation Sequencing, was designed to benefit Indonesia’s budding genomics community.


The curriculum was methodically curated to cover the essentials of genomics, giving participants a robust understanding of various foundational techniques and tools. Central topics included the basics of mapping – a process vital for understanding gene locations; variant calling to detect variants such as SNPs and indels; genome assembly, which is pivotal for constructing long sequences from short DNA fragments; and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that explores the genetic underpinnings of various traits and diseases.


The course emphasized a holistic understanding, ensuring that participants could grasp both the theoretical concepts and their practical applications. Hands-on sessions, practical exercises, and interactive discussions were a significant part of the learning experience, enabling attendees to acquire real-world skills ready for application in their respective fields.


Feedback from those who attended was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the clarity of instruction, the relevance of the course content, and the expertise of Prof Clark's team. The success of the event not only underscores the growing interest in genomics in the region but also showcases the commitment of international experts like Prof Clark and his team to fostering global educational outreach.


Given the rapid advancements in the field of genomics and its ever-increasing applications in healthcare, agriculture, and biodiversity, courses like these play a pivotal role. By equipping researchers and professionals with the latest knowledge and tools, such initiatives ensure that scientific communities worldwide remain at the cutting edge of discovery and innovation.
